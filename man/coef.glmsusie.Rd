\title{Extract Model Coefficients from a glmsusie Object}
\usage{
\method{coef}{glmsusie}(object, intercept = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object of class "glmsusie".}

\item{intercept}{Logical; if TRUE, include the intercept term as the first element
of the returned vector. Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of coefficients, with names corresponding to the column
names of the design matrix. If \code{intercept = TRUE}, the first element
will be named "(Intercept)".
}
\description{
Extracts coefficients from a glmsusie model fit by summing the coefficients
across all single effects for each predictor.
